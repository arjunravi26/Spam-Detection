## Spam Detection Project
This project implements an end-to-end message spam detection model using average word2vec embeddings and a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The model is trained to identify spam messages with high accuracy. The project includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation, all encapsulated in a Scikit-learn pipeline.
